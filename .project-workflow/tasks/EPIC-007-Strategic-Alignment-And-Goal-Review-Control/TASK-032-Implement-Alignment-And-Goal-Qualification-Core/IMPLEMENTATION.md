## User Story

As a person making a consequential decision, I want Strategic Advisor to find
and qualify the outcome I actually mean, so that it does not confidently
execute a proxy or lose settled intent when evidence changes the frame.

## Parent AC Coverage

- AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6

## Child Charter

### Inherited Invariants

- `skills/strategic-advisor/` remains the only executable source of Strategic Advisor logic. This Epic extends existing state and reasoning; it does not add another advisor or state subsystem.
- Stated request, underlying outcome, object class, goal-purpose class, candidate action and readiness remain distinct.
- Bounded reconnaissance may precede alignment. Re-clarification requires both a material delta and an answer that can change the supported action.
- Empirical forks are researched proportionately; owner-only values, constraints, authority and trade-offs remain owner decisions.
- Settled state and unaffected evidence survive a reframe; only evidence whose scope, baseline or meaning changed is invalidated.
- Aspirations may remain visible. Discovery goals require bounded learning and operational goals require proportionate causal support. Readiness is never inferred from the goal-purpose label.
- Tasks and initiatives are not automatic leading indicators. Material progress requires evidence of outcome, driver, constraint or decision movement.
- Goal change is challenged but not prohibited. A qualifying evidence, constraint, value, trade-off or opportunity-cost delta and explicit owner authority permit proportionate revision.
- Event review can pre-empt scheduled cadence. Weekly and monthly cadence are configurable conventions, not universal laws or accountability devices.
- Goal and path dispositions remain separate and identify the exact target of continue, correct, pivot, pause, replace or stop.
- Strategy Workspace is the private durable strategic authority. Daily Checklist, Sunday and Project Workflow remain separate consumers or process systems with no implicit runtime, data or authority coupling.
- Only synthetic, public or irreversibly sanitised cases may be committed. No private or reconstructable task, workspace, employer, client or household data enters public source, runtime, evaluation or package artifacts.
- Exact proof claims remain separated across documented semantics, deterministic/static validation, exact-runtime synthetic behaviour, private real-task dogfood, package identity, publication, host activation, support, adoption and effectiveness.
- The in-flight proportionate-verification-runner worktree is preserved and reconciled before runtime/evaluation implementation; this Epic does not absorb, overwrite or recreate it.
- The downstream Strategy Workspace process is a real v1 to dogfood and iterate, not a disposable pilot, but it remains a separate repository task.
- An allowlisted runtime-byte change prepares the next immutable distribution in the same implementation branch. Push, PR, merge, publication, finalisation, activation and private-workspace mutation require separate authority and exact evidence.

### Invalid Substitutes

- A stated goal, metric, timeframe, desired tool or preferred solution in place of the confirmed underlying outcome and unacceptable substitutes.
- Activity, effort, task completion, output count, tool delivery, praise or visibility in place of material progress toward the goal.
- An initiative or recurring task labelled as a leading indicator without evidence that it predicts or drives the lag outcome.
- Arbitrary milestone interpolation in place of a causal/driver model.
- More questions in place of better alignment, or questions whose answers cannot materially change the supported action.
- Owner preference on an empirical fork in place of accessible evidence, or external evidence in place of an owner-only value or trade-off decision.
- Preserving all prior research after a material scope change in place of selective validity review, or restarting unaffected research in place of state preservation.
- Execution friction, sunk cost, non-execution, boredom, preference repetition or mechanism failure in place of evidence that the goal should change.
- Prior approval in place of justified revision when the goal is obsolete, mistaken, infeasible or no longer worth pursuing.
- A weekly status report, monthly summary or accountability ritual in place of decision-relevant review.
- Documentation, schema checks, unit tests, a plausible answer or model self-assessment in place of exact-runtime behavioural evidence.
- A bounded smoke, owner dogfood or exact-runtime case in place of comparative effectiveness, general support, parity, adoption or cross-host proof.
- Private transcripts, renamed private cases, Strategy Workspace facts, Daily Checklist data or reconstructable owner detail in place of synthetic, public or irreversibly sanitised regressions.
- A generic public template in place of accepted private Strategy Workspace operation, or private dogfood in place of public package/source identity.
- A package build or local prepared ZIP in place of protected-main integration, public publication, fresh download verification or host activation.

### Artifact Targets

- Canonical reasoning: `skills/strategic-advisor/SKILL.md`, `references/recommendation-delta.md`, `references/conversational-strategy.md`, `references/evidence.md`, `references/action-policy.md`, `references/response-contract.md`, `references/strategy-workspace.md`, `references/project-product.md`, and only other directly affected allowlisted references.
- Generic portable records: `workspace-templates/OBJECTIVES.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `WORKSPACE.md` and validator/builder tests, without any private instance data.
- Evaluation authority: `evals/core_cases.json`, `eval_queries.json`, `recommendation_gate_cases.json`, `drift_smoke_cases.json`, generated `evals.json`, the smallest necessary case/assertion/runner changes and exact raw result artifacts kept outside the model-visible runtime.
- Public contract: `PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, onboarding/agent metadata and only directly affected contributor/security documentation.
- Runtime/package declarations: `runtime-manifest.json`, `distribution.json`, generated install-artifact provenance, exact inventories and deterministic package comparison.
- Retained proof: child `EVIDENCE.json`, deterministic validation output, exact-runtime target/source/activation evidence, sanitised raw case outputs, case-level verdicts, independent QA, parent audit and explicit blockers.
- Downstream handoff: a public-contract-derived Strategy Workspace v1 brief identifying private record, dogfood, Sunday and Daily Checklist boundaries without mutating that repository or copying its facts.
- Workflow: EPIC-007 requirements, contract, decomposition, child artifacts, tracker, intent audit, acceptance map/audit, deferrals/amendments if required and retro.

### Parent AC Proof Ownership

- AC1: owner `TASK-032`; required evidence: Canonical state/recommendation-delta diff, duplicate-state scan, matched preservation assertions and QA.
- AC2: owner `TASK-031, TASK-032, TASK-034`; required evidence: Frozen positive/negative authority, direct/reconnaissance/alignment cases, exact-runtime verdicts and QA.
- AC3: owner `TASK-031, TASK-032, TASK-034`; required evidence: Stateful delta/fork/selective-invalidation cases, raw sequence outputs, exact-runtime verdicts and QA.
- AC4: owner `TASK-031, TASK-032, TASK-034`; required evidence: Goal/proxy ladder cases, object-class assertions and exact-runtime review.
- AC5: owner `TASK-031, TASK-032, TASK-034`; required evidence: Aspiration/discovery/operational and readiness cases with stateful assertions and verdicts.
- AC6: owner `TASK-031, TASK-032, TASK-034`; required evidence: Causal indicator/milestone cases, evidence-field assertions and exact-runtime verdicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Existing material-decision state is extended once without semantic regression.
- [ ] AC2: Initial alignment is selective and permits bounded reconnaissance.
- [ ] AC3: Re-clarification, fork routing and selective invalidation match the frozen contract.
- [ ] AC4: Move-up/alternative/move-down goal qualification exposes proxies.
- [ ] AC5: Goal-purpose classes and readiness remain distinct.
- [ ] AC6: Leading and lag indicators require causal evidence rather than task labels.

## Validation

- AC1: Canonical diff, manifest and duplicate-state tests.
- AC2-AC3: Frozen deterministic alignment and stateful sequence cases.
- AC4-AC6: Goal/proxy, discovery/readiness and causal-indicator cases.
